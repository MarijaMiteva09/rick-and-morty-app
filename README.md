# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

A simple React application that fetches and displays a list of Rick and Morty characters from the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).

Additionally, users can toggle the language between English and German using a language switcher in the footer.
